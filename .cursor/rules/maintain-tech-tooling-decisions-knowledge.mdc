# Tech Tooling Documentation Rule

We want to make it clear to new developers why we use external tools and why we decided to use them in the specific setup.

## File Location
The file should be located at: "docs/tech_tooling.md"

## Document Structure
1. Start with a brief introduction explaining the purpose of the document.

2. For each tool, create a section with:
   - H2 title in the format: `## <Tool_Type> - <Tool_Name>`
     Examples:
     - `## Runtime - Node.js`
     - `## Testing - Jest`
     - `## Linting - ESLint`
   
   - Under each tool section:
     - H3 "Why" section explaining the reasoning behind choosing this tool
     - H3 "Configuration" section (where appropriate) detailing integration and setup specifics

## Maintenance Requirements
- The document must be updated whenever:
  1. A new tool is added to the project
  2. An existing tool's configuration is modified
  3. A tool is upgraded with significant changes
  4. A tool is replaced or removed
- Updates should be made in the same PR that introduces these changes
- Both the "Why" and "Configuration" sections should be reviewed and updated as needed

## Example Format
```markdown
## <Tool_Type> - <Tool_Name>

### Why
- Reason 1
- Reason 2
- Reason 3

### Configuration
- Config detail 1
- Config detail 2
- Config detail 3
```
