## Description

## Building and Running the Project

### Development Environment

1. **Install Dependencies**:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Start Development Server with Hot-Reload**:
   ```bash
   just dev
   ```

### Production Environment

1. **Build the Docker Image**:

   ```bash
   docker build -t financial-os .
   ```

2. **Run the Docker Container**:
   ```bash
   docker run -p 3000:3000 financial-os
   ```

This will start the application on port 3000, accessible at `http://localhost:3000`. The production build is optimized for performance and includes only the necessary runtime dependencies.

## Compile and run the project

```bash
# development
$ npm run start

# watch mode
$ npm run start:dev

# production mode
$ npm run start:prod
```

## Run tests

```bash
# unit tests
$ npm run test

# e2e tests
$ npm run test:e2e

# test coverage
$ npm run test:cov
```
