High level project overview

This project consolidates all financial data point a household might have into one place.
- Once we obtain the data, we will parse it.
    Each integration of data-type+data-source will have its own parsing consolidates
- The parsed data will be in a uniform format for all integrations,
    this will ensure we can all data from all sources as a unified corpes.
- After we will parse the data we will need to persist it somewhere,
    it could be local database (sqlite/postgres), csv files, googlesheets
- After we persist the data we will have a presentation layer,
    we will start with a very simple UI to present all transaction with basic filers and a "total line"
    in a later stage we will make it more complex with cool analytics and forcastings.
- Ideally most if not all of the proccess of data collection and injestion should be configurable with a .yml file(s):
    current ideas:
        - data collection:
            user will specify their credit card vendor, bank info.
                if needed they will provide credentials so we can reach the data
                    we will need a security model for that

        - data injestion 
            if we expose something in the .yml files, it means we already know how to injest it.

        - data export:
            user should specify where he wants to persist the data and provide the needed credentials so we can write and read from there

        - ui config
            later!!
        



Kinds of Data points:
- Credit card transactions
- Bank transactions
- Pension funds status and monthly contributions
- Investment funds status and monthly contributions
- Insurnace Payments
- Mortgage status and payments
- Loans status and payment

Data Providers
For every type of data we may have multiple providers, for example:
A familiy could have multiple credit cards from multiple vendors.

Data Source
There may be multiple sources to get data from
Data source examples are:
- CSV files
- Site scraping

Each data source could be acheivied in numerous way:
- Users will provider csv files
- Users will provider credentails so we can log into a website on behalf of the user and get those data files

Every segments of data_type and vendor will have its own integration
